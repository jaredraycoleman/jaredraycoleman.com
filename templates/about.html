                I have a broad interest in computer science and mathematics. 
                In particular, my research interests include distributed computing, online algorithms, edge computing, internet of things (IoT), machine learning (ML),
                artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and cooperative mobile agents.
                I am currently a student at USC, advised by Dr. Bhaskar Krishnamachari and working in the Autonomous Networks Research Group on variety of distributed computing, mobile robotics, blockchain, and IoT problems.

                I am also a Member of the Technical Staff at The Aerospace Corporation, where I have the privilege to develop tools for flight software verification and day-of-launch launch vehicle analysis!

                I am a proud member of the Big Pine Paiute Tribe of the Owens Valley. 
                Besides computer science, I enjoy board games, hiking, history, and language. 
                I am husband to Tainã Coleman, an amazing computer scientist, wife, and friend. 
                I met Tainã in 2013 during my first semester as an undergraduate at CSULB while she was visiting as an international exchange student from Brazil. 
                After her one-year program was up, I followed her back to her university, Universidade Federal de Itajubá and studied there for three semesters. 
                In 2016, we returned to the United States and got married! Tainã and I are both now Ph.D. students at USC.
