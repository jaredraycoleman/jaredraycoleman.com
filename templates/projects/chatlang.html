<p>
    <em>Chatlang</em> (<a href="https://chatlang.net">chatlang.net</a>) is a two-threaded LLM-powered chatbot-based role-playing system.
    Users interact with the system using two chat windows displayed side-by-side in a web interface. The first window is for role-playing, where
    the user and chatbot are expected to never break character and only use the target language. In the
    second window, the user can use their native language to ask questions about the conversation or target
    language and get context-relevant feedback on their mistakes. This design enables uninterrupted roleplaying alongside instant feedback and support.
